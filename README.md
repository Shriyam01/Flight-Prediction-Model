# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction System

This repository contains a machine learning-based **Flight Price Prediction System** built using Python and popular ML libraries. It includes two core notebooks:

- `Flight_Regressor_Model.ipynb`: Handles data preprocessing, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and model training.
- `Flight_Prediction_System.ipynb`: Uses the trained model to make real-time predictions based on user input.

## 📌 Objective

To build a system that predicts flight prices based on multiple input features such as airline, source, destination, number of stops, departure and arrival times, and journey duration.
